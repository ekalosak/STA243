This assignment contains solutions to the genetic programming and simulated
annealing problems. Here both algorithms are implemented in R and used to solve
a piecewise constant regression problem and a small traveling salesman problem
respectively.

# Genetic algorithm

## Setup
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
### Pseudocode overview
# Generate observations used for regression
# Parameterize algorithm
# Initialize random population
# Until convergence
#   Calculate fitness in current generation
#   Mate individuals proportional to fitness
# Plot result

##### BEGIN: Code
rm(list=ls())

### Imports
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")

### Parameterize script
K = 100  # Number of chromosomes in each generation
Gmax = 30  # Maximum number of generations
Pcross = 0.1 # Crossover rate
Pmutate = 0.05 # Mutation rate
which_penalty = "AIC" # "AIC" or "MDL"
```
